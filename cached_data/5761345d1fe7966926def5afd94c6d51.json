This is not group activity. Each student should do the problems and submit it individually.\n2. Assignments have to be handwritten and uploaded as a single pdf file with name BITSID.pdf\n3. Submissions beyond \\( 6^{\\text {th }} \\) July 23.00 hrs would not be graded.\n4. Assignments sent via email/ other electronic forms would not be accepted.\n5. Copying is strictly prohibited. Adoption of unfair means would lead to disciplinary action.\n1) Using only the idea that in the equation \\( \\boldsymbol{C}=\\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{B} \\) where \\( \\boldsymbol{C}, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B} \\) are \\( n \\times n \\) matrices, the \\( i \\) th row of the matrix \\( \\boldsymbol{C} \\) for \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq n \\) is obtained by taking a linear combination of the rows of \\( \\boldsymbol{B} \\) where the combining coefficients come from the \\( i \\) th row of \\( \\boldsymbol{A} \\), show that the inverse of a lower triangular matrix is a lower triangular matrix.\n[2 Marks]\n2) If an integer \\( n \\) is an eigenvalue of square matrix where all elements of a matrix belong to the set of integers, then prove that determinant of that matrix is \\( n k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n[2 Marks]\n3) If \\( \\boldsymbol{A} \\) is a invertible square matrix of order \\( n \\), then prove or disprove that \\( \\operatorname{rank}(\\boldsymbol{A})= \\) \\( \\operatorname{rank}(\\boldsymbol{A B}) \\).\n[2 Marks]\n4) A machine learning researcher comes across the following matrix while analyzing data from a learning problem. He realizes that a careful study of this matrix and its properties will help him design a faster algorithm to solve the learning problem. In this matrix the value of \\( \\mathrm{a}=1 \\) and \\( \\mathrm{b}=-1 \\). He makes an interesting observation that \\( A^{2}=8 \\mathrm{I} \\). He wants to find the answer to the following questions. Derive the answer to the following questions from the properties of the matrix rather than doing long numerical computations involving the full matrix\n\na) What are the eigenvalues of this matrix?\nb) What is the value of the ratio \\( \\frac{\\lambda_{\\{\\max \\}}}{\\lambda_{\\{\\min \\}}} \\) ?\n[2 Marks]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llllllll}\na & a & a & a & a & a & a & a \\\\\na & a & b & b & a & b & b & a \\\\\na & b & a & b & b & a & b & a \\\\\na & b & b & a & b & b & a & a \\\\\na & a & b & b & b & a & a & b \\\\\na & b & a & b & a & b & a & b \\\\\na & b & b & a & a & a & b & b \\\\\na & a & a & a & b & b & b & b\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n5) (a) Let \\( x, y, z \\) be three vectors in a vector space \\( V \\). Show that if \\( x+y+z=0 \\), then \\( \\operatorname{span}\\{x, y\\}=\\operatorname{span}\\{x, z\\}=\\operatorname{span}\\{y, z\\} \\).\n(b) Suppose the vectors \\( v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots v_{n} \\) span \\( V \\). Show that the vectors \\( v_{1}, v_{2}-v_{1}, v_{3}- \\) \\( v_{1}, \\ldots v_{n}-v_{1} \\) also span \\( V \\). Show that if \\( v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots v_{n} \\) are linearly independent, \\( v_{1}, v_{2}- \\) \\( v_{1}, \\ldots v_{n}-v_{1} \\) are also linearly independent.\n[2 Marks]\nEND----"
